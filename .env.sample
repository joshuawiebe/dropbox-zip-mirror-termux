# Dropbox Mirror Configuration Sample
# Copy this file to .dropbox_mirror.env and edit your settings
# Or let setup_termux.sh create it interactively

# REQUIRED: Public Dropbox ZIP download link (must end with ?dl=1)
DROPBOX_URL=https://www.dropbox.com/s/XXXXX/yourfolder.zip?dl=1

# Local paths (repo-local by default, or use custom paths)
DOWNLOAD_PATH=./dropbox_latest.zip
TARGET_DIR=./DropboxMirror
LOG_PATH=./sync.log
VENV_DIR=./.venv

# Alternative: External storage paths
# DOWNLOAD_PATH=~/storage/shared/Download/dropbox_latest.zip  
# TARGET_DIR=~/storage/shared/Documents/MyDropbox
# LOG_PATH=~/storage/shared/Documents/dropbox_sync.log

# Settings
KEEP_VERSIONS=yes          # Archive old versions in TARGET_DIR/.old_versions
DRY_RUN=no                # Set to 'yes' to simulate without writing files

# Notes:
# - Paths starting with ./ are relative to the repository folder
# - Paths starting with ~/ use your home directory  
# - Absolute paths like /storage/... are used as-is
# - The sync script will expand ~ and relative paths automatically
